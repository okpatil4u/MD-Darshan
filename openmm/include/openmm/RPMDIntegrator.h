 * This is an Integrator which simulates a System using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD).
 * It simulates many copies of the System, with successive copies connected by harmonic
 * springs to form a ring.  This allows certain quantum mechanical effects to be efficiently
 * simulated.
 * 
 * Because this Integrator simulates many copies of the System at once, it must be used
 * differently from other Integrators.  Instead of setting positions and velocities by
 * calling methods of the Context, you should use the corresponding methods of the Integrator
 * to set them for specific copies of the System.  Similarly, you should retrieve state information
 * for particular copies by calling getState() on the Integrator.  Do not query the Context for
 * state information.
